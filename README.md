# Councils in crisis: Town Hall debt levels staggering, MPs warn

![](INSERT URL PHOTO HERE)

A BBC Shared Data Unit analysis of data by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities [shows](INSERT URL BBC NEWS HERE) UK councils owe a combined £97.8bn to lenders, equivalent to £1,141 per resident, as of September 2023.

Taking into account all types of local authorities, such as police and crime commissioners and combined authorities, the debt pile rose to £122bn.

High levels of local authority debt would see residents face an "extreme and long-lasting" impact on local services, the Public Accounts Committee warned.

But council leaders said years of under-funding meant they had been forced to take out loans and invest in commercial properties just to keep services running.
